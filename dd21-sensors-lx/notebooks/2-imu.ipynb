    "An IMU is a device that uses accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure\n",
    "forces (via accelerations) and angular rates acting on a body. The IMU\n",
    "on the Duckiedrone is a built-in component of the flight controller. Data\n",
    "provided by the IMU are used by the state estimator, which you will be\n",
    "implementing in the next project, to better understand its motion in\n",
    "flight. In addition, the flight controller uses the IMU data to\n",
    "stabilize the drone from small perturbations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IMU can be used to measure global orientation of roll and pitch, but **not** yaw.  This is because it measures acceleration due to gravity, so it can measure the downward pointing gravity\n",
    "vector.  However, this information does not give a global yaw measurement.  Many\n",

    "according to the Earth's magnetic field, but the Duckiedrone does not\n",

    "integrated again to measure position.  However, without some absolute\n",
